## SCSS-SASS

 SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are both used for styling web pages, but they differ in several key ways:

# Syntax and Features
 CSS: A stylesheet language with basic functionality for styling web pages, where styles are applied through selectors, properties, and values.
 SASS: A preprocessor for CSS that extends CSS's capabilities. SASS allows for features like variables, nesting, inheritance, and mixins, which are not available in standard CSS.
